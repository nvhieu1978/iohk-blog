The Shelley Incentivized Testnet is proving to be an incredible journey. Originally, we hoped for around 100 pools. As of today, we've reached over 1,000 registered and more than 670 active pools. Over 11.5B ada is now being staked on the testnet. The many improvements to performance have resulted in an increase in uptime â€“ but there's still a way to go. We are not resting on our laurels, even for a minute, and efforts to improve stability and performance are ongoing. 

Still, the progress to date is a remarkable testament to the commitment of our incredible Cardano community, which grows in number and passion every day. 

Weâ€™re started compiling some testnet statistics, a few of which weâ€™ve captured here. Transparency is always our goal: we want the community to see what we see. To that end, here's a look at the Incentivized Testnet's story so far, along with a flavor of the community's reaction. We'll continue to gather community feedback and data, and we'll be sharing these as we go forward. So stay tuned as we continue to chart our journey.
