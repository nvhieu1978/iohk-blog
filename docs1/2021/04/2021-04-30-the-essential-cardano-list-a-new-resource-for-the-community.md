Today sees the publication of [the Essential Cardano list](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano) â€“ a new GitHub repository which will help you to find out everything you need to know about Cardano. Whether you want to understand what Cardano is and who our partners are, learn about our mission and roadmap, or get stuck in and build on Cardano, this is the place to start.

Inspired by GitHub's well known *Awesome* lists, the Essential Cardano list provides an outline of our thriving ecosystem, as well as a comprehensive list of resources to help you learn more and get started. As it grows and expands, this new list aims to become the canonical source of material for Cardano, including both official resources and community-generated materials. We are now looking for our community members to help us extend it even more by contributing their suggestions.
## **A central location of essential resources**
We want to have a central location for all things Cardano, to bring everything together and make it easy for people to find what they need. We have provided links to all official sites, channels, and resources, as well as to a collection of material such as explainers, guides, developer resources, glossaries, primers, tutorials, and much more.

On top of that, we have identified assets developed by the community which we think provide great value and complement our own content that we produce. Our aim is that our community will now help us to grow it out and make it even better.
## **Navigate the Cardano ecosystem**
Essential Cardano provides an outline of all the core entities, partner groups, and facets that are part of our growing ecosystem to help orientate you to understand all the existing and new relationships that are being developed. 

Initially, our focus has been on curating links and references to whatâ€™s going on within our growing ecosystem. As we update the list, or additions are made by community members, the list will also grow. We also plan to add additional visual elements including infographics and ecosystem maps over time. We have included an existing [ecosystem map](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md#navigate-the-cardano-ecosystem) which is currently being refreshed by our team to reflect new relationships and partnerships we have formed recently. We plan to release a May version of this map very soon, so if you would like to help us get this up to date as soon as possible, go ahead and raise a pull request with your suggestion! 

We have also included all the Project Catalyst startups that currently exist so you can understand some of what is being planned for future development. 
## **How do I contribute?**
We are looking for you to help us to grow out and evolve this essential Cardano list. This list is fully open source so if you know of new content that is being produced by members of the community, new relationships that are not included, or new innovations, please let us know so that we can add them all to this list and promote them. The easiest way to do this is to [raise a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request/) on the repository. Weâ€™ll evaluate these regularly and provide feedback within each pull request.
## **Growing this list**
2021 is already a very active year for growth and engagement on Cardano. Following on from yesterday's exciting announcements about our [vision for Africa](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/28/decentralized-identity-on-the-blockchain-is-the-key-to-iohks-vision-for-africa/), and with upcoming [smart contracts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/08/smart-contracts-%E2%80%93-here-we-come/) and other new products on the way, we expect lots of new and exciting additions. We have already included some contributions from our active [Plutus Pioneers course](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-our-new-plutus-pioneer-program/), which are very welcome, and we anticipate many more users, developers, and enterprises jumping on board in the coming months. We are happy to see the new [Cardano Q & A Stack Exchange](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/users/login?ssrc=beta&returnurl=%2f) being developed and would encourage our community members to submit their questions to help build this out. Stay tuned for announcements and updates here on our blog, social channels, and within the [Essential Cardano repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/essential-cardano) itself.
